```

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python:** 3.10 or later
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):** An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust
- **AgentMail Account:** Sign up for AgentMail to get your API key
- **Blaxel Platform Setup:** Complete Blaxel setup by following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started#quickstart)
  - **[Blaxel CLI](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started):** Ensure you have the Blaxel CLI installed. If not, install it globally:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh | BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
    ```
  - **Blaxel login:** Login to Blaxel platform
    ```bash
    bl login YOUR-WORKSPACE
    ```

## üíª Installation

**Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-agentmail-docbot.git
cd template-agentmail-docbot
uv sync
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configure the following environment variables for your DocBot deployment:

```env
INBOX_USERNAME=      # a unique username for your DocBot's inbox
AGENTMAIL_API_KEY=   # your AgentMail API key
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root with these variables, or set them in your deployment environment.

## üîß Usage

### Running Locally

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
bl serve --hotreload
```

For production run:

```bash
bl serve
```

_Note:_ The development server automatically restarts when you make changes to the source code.

### Testing

You can test your DocBot agent locally:

```bash
# Using the Blaxel CLI chat interface
bl chat --local template-agentmail-docbot
```

Example queries you can test:

```
How do I implement OAuth authentication in FastAPI?
```

```
What are the best practices for database migrations in Django?
```

```
Can you explain the difference between async and sync functions in Python?
```

You can also run it directly with specific input:

```bash
bl run agent docbot-agent --local --data '{"input": "How do I handle CORS in Express.js?"}'
```

### Deployment

When you are ready to deploy your DocBot:

```bash
bl deploy
```

This command uses your code and the configuration files under the `.blaxel` directory to deploy your DocBot on the Blaxel platform. Once deployed, users can email your DocBot at `{INBOX_USERNAME}@agentmail.to`.
